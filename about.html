                    <p><strong>I have always had a mutual love of creativity and logic. </strong><br><br>I started playing piano and learning
                        music theory at a very young age, and this was the first time the two were introduced to one
                        another. <br><br>I was raised in beautiful Santa Barbara, California, and dove headfirst into music and
                        anything computer-related. The first operating system I was lucky enough to play around with was
                        MS-DOS.  It was amazing. The computer was the perfect tool to blend the creative and logical
                        mind together. I was hooked.
                        <br><br>I continued my career in music, learning multiple DAW recording interfaces and numerous Adobe
                        products, which led me to a path of freelance graphic design. Eventually I wanted to know more
                        about how my favorite programs worked 'behind the scenes', so I decided to look into
                        programming. <br><br>I enrolled in an intensive computer software program through the University of San
                        Diego in September, 2020 that provided close to 1000 hours of instruction and further proved my love for problem solving. This course helped me
                        solidify many of the cornerstone programming technologies such as Javascript, CSS, HTML, NodeJS,
                        MySQL, and React. 
                        <br><br>I am very much looking forward to continuing my career as a software developer, and would love
                        to connect! </p>
